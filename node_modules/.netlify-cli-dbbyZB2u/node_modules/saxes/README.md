# saxes

A sax-style non-validating parser for XML.

Saxes is a fork of [sax](https://github.com/isaacs/sax-js) 1.2.4. All mentions

Designed with [node](http://nodejs.org/) in mind, but should work fine in the
browser or other CommonJS implementations.

Saxes does not support Node versions older than 8.

  Saxes aims for conformance with [XML 1.0 fifth
  edition](https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-xml-20081126/) and [XML Namespaces 1.0
  third edition](http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/REC-xml-names-20091208/).
